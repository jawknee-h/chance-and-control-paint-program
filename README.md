# chance-and-control-paint-program
An unorthodox paint program, written with C++ and openFrameworks in October 2022.

To run it you'll need to download openFrameworks, make a new project with the project generator and then copy the 'src' folder, addons.make file, and bin/data folder into the project directory. Then compile and run.
