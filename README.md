To run it you'll need to download openFrameworks, make a new project with the project generator and then copy the 'src' folder, addons.make file, and bin/data folder into the project directory. Then compile and run.

</p>

#### Slicing and Shifting
The canvas can be split into multiple segments which will repeat.
Pressing '-' will decrease the number of slices and '=' will increase.
Pressing '[' or ']' will shift the canvas left or right.
